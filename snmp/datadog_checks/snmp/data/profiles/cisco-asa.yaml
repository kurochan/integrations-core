      among all its ''sibling'' components. Sibling components are defined as entPhysicalEntries
      that share the same instance values of each of the entPhysicalContainedIn and
      entPhysicalClass objects. An NMS can use this object to identify the relative
      ordering for all sibling components of a particular parent (identified by the
      entPhysicalContainedIn instance in each sibling entry). If possible, this value
      should match any external labeling of the physical component. For example, for
      a container (e.g., card slot) labeled as ''slot #3'', entPhysicalParentRelPos
      should have the value ''3''. Note that the entPhysicalEntry for the module plugged
      in slot 3 should have an entPhysicalParentRelPos value of ''1''. If the physical
      position of this component does not match any external numbering or clearly
      visible ordering, then user documentation or other external reference material
      should be used to determine the parent-relative position. If this is not possible,
      then the agent should assign a consistent (but possibly arbitrary) ordering
      to a given set of ''sibling'' components, perhaps based on internal representation
      of the components. If the agent cannot determine the parent-relative position
      for some reason, or if the associated value of entPhysicalContainedIn is ''0'',
      then the value ''-1'' is returned. Otherwise, a non-negative integer is returned,
      indicating the parent-relative position of this physical entity. Parent-relative
      ordering normally starts from ''1'' and continues to ''N'', where ''N'' represents
      the highest positioned child entity. However, if the physical entities (e.g.,
      slots) are labeled from a starting position of zero, then the first sibling
      should be associated with an entPhysicalParentRelPos value of ''0''. Note that
      this ordering may be sparse or dense, depending on agent implementation. The
      actual values returned are not globally meaningful, as each ''parent'' component
      may use different numbering algorithms. The ordering is only meaningful among
      siblings of the same parent component. The agent should retain parent-relative
      position values across reboots, either through algorithmic assignment or use
      of non-volatile storage.'

      is unknown or non-existent, the entPhysicalSerialNum will be set to a zero-length
      string instead. Note that implementations that can correctly identify the serial
      numbers of all installed physical entities do not need to provide write access
      to the entPhysicalSerialNum object. Agents that cannot provide non-volatile
      storage for the entPhysicalSerialNum strings are not required to implement write

      write access for such entities and may return a zero-length string. If write
      access is implemented for an instance of entPhysicalSerialNum and a value is
      written into the instance, the agent must retain the supplied value in the entPhysicalSerialNum
      instance (associated with the same physical entity) for as long as that entity

      only the most appropriate physical component, which is closest to the root of
      a particular containment tree, should be identified in an entLPMapping entry.
      For example, suppose a bridge is realized on a particular module, and all ports
      on that module are ports on this bridge. A mapping between the bridge and the
      module would be useful, but additional mappings between the bridge and each

      listed here is allowed. Variables are expressed as a dollar sign (''$'') and
      an integer that corresponds to an expObjectIndex. An example of a valid expression
      is: ($1-$5)*100 Expressions may not be recursive, that is although an expression
      may use the results of another expression, it may not contain any variable that
      is directly or indirectly a result of its own evaluation. The only allowed operators
      are: ( ) - (unary) + - * / % & | ^ << >> ~ ! && || == != > >= < <= Note the
      parentheses are included for parenthesizing the expression, not for casting
      data types. The only constant types defined are: int (32-bit signed) long (64-bit
      signed) unsigned int unsigned long hexadecimal character string oid The default
      type for a positive integer is int unless it is too large in which case it is
      long. All but oid are as defined for ANSI C. Note that a hexadecimal constant
      may end up as a scalar or an array of 8-bit integers. A string constant is enclosed
      in double quotes and may contain back-slashed individual characters as in ANSI
      C. An oid constant comprises 32-bit, unsigned integers and at least one period,
      for example: 0. .0 1.3.6.1 Integer-typed objects are treated as 32- or 64-bit,
      signed or unsigned integers, as appropriate. The results of mixing them are
      as for ANSI C, including the type of the result. Note that a 32-bit value is
      thus promoted to 64 bits only in an operation with a 64-bit value. There is
      no provision for larger values to handle overflow. Relative to SNMP data types,
      a resulting value becomes unsigned when calculating it uses any unsigned value,
      including a counter. To force the final value to be of data type counter the
      expression must explicitly use the counter32() or counter64() function (defined
      below). OCTET STRINGS and OBJECT IDENTIFIERs are treated as 1-based arrays of
      unsigned 8-bit integers and unsigned 32-bit integers, respectively. IpAddresses
      are treated as 32-bit, unsigned integers in network byte order, that is, the
      hex version of 255.0.0.0 is 0xff000000. Conditional expressions result in a
      32-bit, unsigned integer of value 0 for false or 1 for true. When an arbitrary
      value is used as a boolean 0 is false and non-zero is true. Rules for the resulting
      data type from an operation, based on the operator: For << and >> the result
      is the same as the left hand operand. For &&, ||, ==, !=, <, <=, >, and >= the
      result is always Unsigned32. For unary - the result is always Integer32. For
      +, -, *, /, %, &, |, and ^ the result is promoted according to the following
      rules, in order from most to least preferred: If left hand and right hand operands
      are the same type, use that. If either side is Counter64, use that. If either
      side is IpAddress, use that. If either side is TimeTicks, use that. If either
      side is Counter32, use that. Otherwise use Unsigned32. The following rules say
      what operators apply with what data types. Any combination not explicitly defined
      does not work. For all operators any of the following can be the left hand or
      right hand operand: Integer32, Counter32, Unsigned32, Counter64. The operators
      +, -, *, /, %, <, <=, >, and >= also work with TimeTicks. The operators &, |,
      and ^ also work with IpAddress. The operators << and >> also work with IpAddress
      but only as the left hand operand. The + operator performs a concatenation of
      two OCTET STRINGs or two OBJECT IDENTIFIERs. The operators &, | perform bitwise
      operations on OCTET STRINGs. If the OCTET STRING happens to be a DisplayString
      the results may be meaningless, but the agent system does not check this as
      some such systems do not have this information. The operators << and >> perform
      bitwise operations on OCTET STRINGs appearing as the left hand operand. The
      only functions defined are: counter32 counter64 arraySection stringBegins stringEnds
      stringContains oidBegins oidEnds oidContains sum exists The following function
      definitions indicate their by naming the data type of the parameter in the parameter''s
      position in the parameter list. The parameter must be of the type indicated
      and generally may be a constant, a MIB object, a function, or an expression.
      counter32(integer) - wrapped around an integer value counter32 forces Counter32
      as a data type. counter64(integer) - similar to counter32 except that the resulting
      data type is ''counter64''. arraySection(array, integer, integer) - selects
      a piece of an array (i.e. part of an OCTET STRING or OBJECT IDENTIFIER). The
      integer arguments are in the range 0 to 4,294,967,295. The first is an initial
      array index (1-based) and the second is an ending array index. A value of 0
      indicates first or last element, respectively. If the first element is larger
      than the array length the result is 0 length. If the second integer is less
      than or equal to the first, the result is 0 length. If the second is larger
      than the array length it indicates last element. stringBegins/Ends/Contains(octetString,
      octetString) - looks for the second string (which can be a string constant)
      in the first and returns the 1-based index where the match began. A return value
      of 0 indicates no match (i.e. boolean false). oidBegins/Ends/Contains(oid, oid)
      - looks for the second OID (which can be an OID constant) in the first and returns
      the the 1-based index where the match began. A return value of 0 indicates no
      match (i.e. boolean false). sum(integerObject*) - sums all availiable values
      of the wildcarded integer object, resulting in an integer scalar. Must be used
      with caution as it wraps on overflow with no notification. exists(anyTypeObject)

    description: 'This table contains one entry per interface. It defines objects
      which allow a network manager to instruct an agent to test an interface for
      various faults. Tests for an interface are defined in the media-specific MIB
      for that interface. After invoking a test, the object ifTestResult can be read
      to determine the outcome. If an agent can not perform the test, ifTestResult
      is set to so indicate. The object ifTestCode can be used to provide further
      test- specific or interface-specific (or even enterprise-specific) information
      concerning the outcome of the test. Only one test can be in progress on each
      interface at any one time. If one test is in progress when another test is invoked,
      the second test is rejected. Some agents may reject a test when a prior test
      is active on another interface. Before starting a test, a manager-station must
      first obtain ''ownership'' of the entry in the ifTestTable for the interface
      to be tested. This is accomplished with the ifTestId and ifTestStatus objects
      as follows: try_again: get (ifTestId, ifTestStatus) while (ifTestStatus != notInUse)
      /* * Loop while a test is running or some other * manager is configuring a test.
      */ short delay get (ifTestId, ifTestStatus) } /* * Is not being used right now
      -- let''s compete * to see who gets it. */ lock_value = ifTestId if ( set(ifTestId
      = lock_value, ifTestStatus = inUse, ifTestOwner = ''my-IP-address'') == FAILURE)
      /* * Another manager got the ifTestEntry -- go * try again */ goto try_again;
      /* * I have the lock */ set up any test parameters. /* * This starts the test
      */ set(ifTestType = test_to_run); wait for test completion by polling ifTestResult
      when test completes, agent sets ifTestResult agent also sets ifTestStatus =
      ''notInUse'' retrieve any additional test results, and ifTestId if (ifTestId
      == lock_value+1) results are valid A manager station first retrieves the value
      of the appropriate ifTestId and ifTestStatus objects, periodically repeating
      the retrieval if necessary, until the value of ifTestStatus is ''notInUse''.
      The manager station then tries to set the same ifTestId object to the value
      it just retrieved, the same ifTestStatus object to ''inUse'', and the corresponding
      ifTestOwner object to a value indicating itself. If the set operation succeeds
      then the manager has obtained ownership of the ifTestEntry, and the value of
      the ifTestId object is incremented by the agent (per the semantics of TestAndIncr).
      Failure of the set operation indicates that some other manager has obtained
      ownership of the ifTestEntry. Once ownership is obtained, any test parameters
      can be setup, and then the test is initiated by setting ifTestType. On completion
      of the test, the agent sets ifTestStatus to ''notInUse''. Once this occurs,
      the manager can retrieve the results. In the (rare) event that the invocation
      of tests by two network managers were to overlap, then there would be a possibility
      that the first test''s results might be overwritten by the second test''s results
      prior to the first results being read. This unlikely circumstance can be detected
      by a network manager retrieving ifTestId at the same time as retrieving the
      test results, and ensuring that the results are for the desired request. If
      ifTestType is not set within an abnormally long period of time after ownership
      is obtained, the agent should time-out the manager, and reset the value of the
      ifTestStatus object back to ''notInUse''. It is suggested that this time-out
      period be 5 minutes. In general, a management station must not retransmit a
      request to invoke a test for which it does not receive a response; instead,
      it properly inspects an agent''s MIB to determine if the invocation was successful.
      Only if the invocation was unsuccessful, is the invocation request retransmitted.
      Some tests may require the interface to be taken off-line in order to execute
      them, or may even require the agent to reboot after completion of the test.
      In these circumstances, communication with the management station invoking the
      test may be lost until after completion of the test. An agent is not required
      to support such tests. However, if such tests are supported, then the agent
      should make every effort to transmit a response to the request which invoked
      the test prior to losing communication. When the agent is restored to normal
      service, the results of the test are properly made available in the appropriate
      objects. Note that this requires that the ifIndex value assigned to an interface
      must be unchanged even if the test causes a reboot. An agent must reject any
      test for which it cannot, perhaps due to resource constraints, make available
      at least the minimum amount of information after that test completes.'
